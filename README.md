# E-Commerce-Back-End<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  This is a sample back-end to an Ecommerce site where details for products are saved into a mySQL database. I was tasked with connecting the back end so that users are able to use Insomnia or Postman to query the database for products, add new products to the database or make changes to the products (i.e. to prices, amounts in stock, product categories, and various tags).  The application uses Node.js, Express, mySQL, and Sequelize NPM packages.

  See screenshot below:
